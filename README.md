## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify SMS or email messages as either **Spam** or **Ham** (not spam) using supervised machine learning models. It leverages text processing techniques such as tokenization, vectorization (TF-IDF), and algorithms like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression.
